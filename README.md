# Space_Invaders 

This is a rendition of the classic Space Invaders game, created with the Python, the PyGame, Random, and Math modules.

The player controls the spaceship at the bottom of the screen with the left and right arrows, and fires missiles with
the space bar.

With each missile-enemy collision, the score increases by one point, while the enemy speed increases by 0.05.

In this variation, the "invaders" are Greta Thurnberg clones.  

Greta Thurnberg has approved of the use of her image, and David Bowie has agreed to the use of "Space Oddity" for this game.

When this game is ultimately released commercially, all profits are to be dedicated to the Children Alien Abduction Fund, 
as stipulated in the agreements with Greta Thurnberg and David Bowie.  It is our collective hope that one day soon we may
do our part to help children escape this dying planet and join Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.
